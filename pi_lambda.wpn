We assume Π to be a π-system, and want to show that λ(Π) is a σ-algebra. As we already know that λ(Π) is a λ-system, by the lemma `π_and_λ_is_σ` we only need to show that λ(Π) is a π-system. The proof is divided into three parts, exactly as exercise 2.4.6. \n\nIn the first part, we introduce the collection of sets $H$, and show that it is a λ-system. This will be the longest part of the proof, and involves quite a few additional lemma's and definitions. Before defining $H$, we will first prove some smaller results. All of these come together in the proof of `H_is_λ_system`. \n\n### Disjoint unions in λ(Π)\nOne of the properties of  λ-systems that we want to use, is that the union of two disjoint sets in λ(Π) is again in λ(Π). \nTo prove this, we use that λ-systems are closed under taking the countable union of disjoint sequences of sets. We introduce the sequence $(A,B,∅,∅,...)$ for disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, and then prove three statements. First we prove that the countable union of this sequence is the union of $A$ and $B$, next that the sequence is indeed disjoint, and finally, using the first two, that for $A, B ∈ λ(Π)$, we have that $A ∪ B ∈ λ(Π)$.
