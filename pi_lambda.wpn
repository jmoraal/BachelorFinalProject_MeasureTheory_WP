For this, we make use of the sequence $(A,B,∅,∅,...)$ as presented in the `sets` library, for $A$ and $B$ disjoint.  We will use two statements about this sequence. First, that the countable union of this sequence is the union of $A$ and $B$, in `CU_aux_is_union`.\nNext, from `disjoint_aux` we know that the sequence is indeed disjoint.

This is a step towards $A ∩ B$ being in λ(Π) for all $A, B ∈ λ(Π)$, which is exactly what we wanted to prove (this is the condition for being a π-system). \nIn both cases, $H$ will play an important role in the proof, which somewhat justifies the amount of time and effort we have spent on it. \n\nFirst, we consider the situation where $A∈λ(Π)$ and $B∈Π$.
